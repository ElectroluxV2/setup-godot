jobs:
  tests:
    name: üëÄ Evaluate on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      # Don't cancel other OS runners if one fails.
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        # Put the operating systems you want to run on here.
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    env:

        run: dotnet restore

      - uses: chickensoft-games/setup-godot@v2
        name: ü§ñ Setup Godot
        with:
          # Version must include major, minor, and patch, and be >= 4.0.0
          # Pre-release label is optional.
          version: 4.0.0-beta16 # also valid: 4.0.0.rc1 or 4.0.0 or "global.json", etc
          # Use .NET-enabled version of Godot (the default is also true).
          use-dotnet: true
          # Include the Godot Export Templates (the default is false).
          include-templates: true

      - name: üî¨ Verify Setup
        run: |
          dotnet --version
          godot --version

      - name: üßë‚Äçüî¨ Generate .NET Bindings
        run: godot --headless --build-solutions --quit || exit 0

      - name: ü¶∫ Build Projects
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release

## Inputs

See [action.yml][action] for the complete guide to all of the action's inputs.

### Specifying the Godot Version

The Godot version should be specified the same as any [GodotSharp] version string: e.g., `4.0.0-beta1`, `4.0.0-beta.16`, `4.0.0`, etc.

In place of a version, you can specify `global` or `global.json` to use the version of Godot specified by the project's global.json file.

```yaml
  - uses: chickensoft-games/setup-godot@v2
    name: ü§ñ Setup Godot
    with:
      version: global.json # use Godot version specified by global.json
```

For that to work, your project must have a `global.json` file in the root directory with contents similar to the following.

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "6.0.406",
    "rollForward": "latestMinor"
  },
  "msbuild-sdks": {
    "Godot.NET.Sdk": "4.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Important:** If using a global.json file in your project, do *not* specify the version of the Godot.NET.Sdk in your project's `.csproj` file. Note that Godot tends to add this back to your `.csproj` file every time you save the Godot project, so discard those changes before committing to source control.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Godot.NET.Sdk"> <!-- GOOD -->
<Project Sdk="Godot.NET.Sdk/4.0.0"> <!-- BAD -->
```
